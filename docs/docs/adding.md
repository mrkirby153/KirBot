# Adding KirBot
Adding KirBot to your server can be done via two ways:

## Direct Link
Click [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=261292113046667276&permissions=485878983&scope=bot) to add the bot to your server.

## Web Admin
You can also add the bot to your server from the web admin panel. Click [here](https://kirbot.mrkirby153.com/servers) then click on any server under the **Add To Your Server** heading to add the bot to your server.


## Server Setup
After adding the bot a few setup tasks must be performed.

1. Ensure the bot has the neccecary permissions to function (this should automatically be completed when adding the bot)
2. Positioning KirBot's role such that it can interact with the most users possible
    * KirBot can only interact with roles lower than its highest role in the role heirarchy, so ensure KirBot's highest role is as high as possible.
