# KirBot

KirBot started its life as a Minecraft bridge bot, but has since developed from there into a fully fledged moderation bot. There are also some non-moderation features which can be disabled on the bot admin panel.

## Adding

See [adding](adding.md) for instructions on how to add KirBot to your server.

## Contributing
KirBot is open source and available [here](https://github.com/mrkirby153/KirBot). The `master` branch contains the currently deployed code and the `develop` branch contains unstable code and isn't meant for production.
