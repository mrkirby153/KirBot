# General Settings
The general settings tab contains miscelaneous settings that do not fall into other channels.

## Logging
Configure modlog settings. Log events can be configured per channel and the bot supports an unlimited number of logging channels per server.

Log events are filtered into two modes: Include and Exclude. When events are included, _only_ those events will be included in the modlogs for that channel. When events are excluded every event _except_ those on the list will be included in the channel.

Set the timezone of the logs with the **Log Timezone** field. Most conventional timezones are supported. In the event an unrecognized timezone being entered, the bot will silently fall back to UTC.

## Bot Nickname
Set the nickname of the bot. There is a maximum of 32 characters for the nickanme (Discord enforced)

## Muted Role
Set the role that's applied to the user when they are muted via bot commands or as a spam violation punishment

## User Persistence
User persistence allows for roles, nicknames, and voice states to be preserved even if a user leaves the server. Upon rejoining, KirBot will attempt to restore the user's roles, nickanmes, and voice state.

### Settings
* **Persist Mute** - Persist the user's server mute in a voice channel
* **Persist Roles** - Restore a user's roles when they rejoin. A whitelist can be configured. If the whitelist is blank _all_ roles will be restored when rejoining.
* **Persist Deafen** - A user's server deafen state will be persisted
* **Persist Nickname** - A user's nickname will be automatically restored, assuming the bot has permission to interact with the user.

## Channel Whitelist
Configure channels that the bot can execute commands in. Most moderation commands ignore the command whitelist.

## Starboard/Quotes
KirBot supports both starboards and quotes. These two features are mutually exclusive and enabling the starboard will disable the quoting features.

### Quoting
When the starboard is disabled, reacting to _any_ message with ðŸ—¨ will create a quote. The quote ID will be displayed and can later be retrieved with the `quote <id>` command.

### Starboard
In addition to quoting, a starboard can be used instead.

**Starboard Channel** - The channel where starboard posts will be sent

**Star Count** - The amount of star reactions needed to add the post to the starboard

**Gild Count** - The amount of star reactions needed to "gild" a post

**Self Star** - If users are allowed to star their own post.
