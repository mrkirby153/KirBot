# Infractions

This page lists all of the infractions currently recorded by KirBot. Infractions can be filtered
by typing the filter query into the boxes near the top of each row.

## Log Manual Actions

KirBot by default does not create infractions for actions that are done manually through Discord's UI
(such as manually kicking or banning a user). Enable this toggle to have KirBot create infractions
for manual actions.
