# General Settings
This page controls various miscellaneous settings of KirBot.

## Real Name Settings
This controls if KirBot will manage real names (useful on smaller servers). Real Names can be "required" in the sense they will be assigned a role if they haven't had their real name set.

Real Names can currently be displayed in two different formats: Full name (first and last) or just the first name only.

## Logging
KirBot can log various actions such as message edits, deletes, mutes and unmutes. This setting configures which channel the messages are logged to.

## Bot Nickname
This sets KirBot's nickname on the server. This setting should update immediately.

**NOTE:** This requires that KirBot can change its own Nickname

## Channel Whitelist
It may be useful to restrict most (but not all) commands to a designated channel (i.e `#bot-spam`). The channels can be set here. If the setting is left blank, KirBot will acknowledge all commands in _all_ channels.

## Bot Manager Roles
This sets which roles are "Bot Manager" roles (see clearance for more information). If a role was just added on the server, it may take a few minutes to update on the panel.
