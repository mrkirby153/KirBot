# KirBot Control Panel

KirBot comes with a web administration panel (pictured below) to configure various parts of it.

The web panel can be accessed [here](https://kirbot.mrkirby153.com/). The panel is accessable for anyone who has the `Manage Server` permission on Discord.

The panel is split up into various tabs, each configuring a different part of KirBot. See the respective pages for more information.

It is important to note that channel names are retrieved from KirBot's database when the page loads. This means that channels that were just created may not show up immediately on the dashboard. To view a list of channels that KirBot has registered, see the `Channels` dashboard tab.
